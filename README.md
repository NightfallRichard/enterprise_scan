## Features

### 1. Distributed Scanning Architecture
- **Task Queue with Redis:**  
  Uses a Redis cluster to distribute scanning tasks to multiple worker nodes.
- **Real-Time Result Aggregation:**  
  Aggregates scan results via a Redis pub/sub channel, ensuring timely notifications.

### 2. ML-Powered Anomaly Detection
- **Isolation Forest Model:**  
  Uses scikit-learn’s Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection.
- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis:**  
  Processes HTTP responses to detect anomalous behavior, reducing false positives.

### 3. Cloud Security Testing
- **Metadata Exposure Checks:**  
  Validates the security posture of cloud metadata services across AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- **Cloud Storage and Serverless Audits:**  
  Extensible for additional tests such as storage configuration audits and serverless function security checks.

### 4. Burp Suite Integration
- **Automated Scanning:**  
  Integrates with Burp Suite Enterprise API to trigger scans and import vulnerability findings.
- **Result Correlation:**  
  Maps vulnerabilities from Burp Suite into a consolidated report.

### 5. Advanced Protocol Testing
- **WebSocket Protocol Analysis:**  
  Detects potential Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking and other protocol-level vulnerabilities.
- **Binary Protocol Fuzzing & Stateful Analysis:**  
  Framework is extensible to support additional advanced protocol tests.

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- **Security Gates Implementation:**  
  Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to enforce security tests before deployment.
- **Automated Build Blocking:**  
  Fails builds automatically if critical vulnerabilities are detected.

### 7. Compliance Automation
- **Regulatory Compliance Checks:**  
  Validates findings against compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
- **Automated Control Mapping:**  
  Generates audit-ready reports with remediation guidance.

## Usage

### Running the Framework

To run a comprehensive enterprise scan on a target URL:

```bash
python enterprise_scan.py --target https://example.com
```

For testing purposes, you may use a WebSocket echo endpoint:

```bash
python enterprise_scan.py --target ws://echo.websocket.org
```

### Usage Scenarios

- **Distributed Compliance-Focused Scan:**

  ```bash
  python enterprise_scan.py --compliance gdpr pci-dss

  ```bash
  python enterprise_scan.py --cloud aws gcp
  ```

- **CI/CD Pipeline Security Gates:**

  ```bash
  python enterprise_scan.py --ci jenkins --fail-on critical
  ```

- **WebSocket Protocol Security Test:**

  ```bash
  python enterprise_scan.py --protocol websocket
  ```

### Command-Line Arguments

The framework supports several command-line arguments to tailor your scans:
- `--target`: Specify the target URL or WebSocket endpoint.
- `--compliance`: Choose compliance standards (e.g., `gdpr`, `pci-dss`).
- `--cloud`: Specify cloud providers to test (e.g., `aws`, `gcp`).
- `--ci`: Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., `jenkins`).
- `--fail-on`: Define vulnerability severity levels that should block the build.
